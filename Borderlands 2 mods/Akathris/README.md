-Kitty

A pretty ok gun for my first try.
I do plan on fixing and balancing it in the next few years at this rate, although some things are fixed from the old edition.


-American Patriot

It's an alright skin but Yurot/WarMocK made a better one lol, although it's alright for a skin made with little time and effort. Will not come back to it probably.


-M392 DMR

This is supposed to resemble the gun of the same name from Halo
Yes it's an assault rifle don't reeee me for it, it's for the 'aesthetic'.
I also plan on balancing this too I guess, not in my best interest honestly.


-Sal the Invincible

Makes Sal Invincible ![](https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/emoticons/v1/64138/3.0)
This is 100% a joke literally no reason to have this lol.


-No More Moxxi Lifesteal

Pretty self explanatory, removes lifesteal from Moxxi weapons and changes it to passive health regen.
Keep in mind that not much testing has gone into this yet and it is in no way balanced fully.
There are some stat, name, and red text changes but you can pick and choose what you want in BLCMM.
I am gonna work on this only for now until people are happy with it tbh.


-Another Hecking Sal Mod

This one actually does something lol, has options for less Sal screms (Thanks to Mike/soze <3)
Can also toggle Gunzerk if ya wanna.
Has a choice between the health regen being buffed (I think) and lifesteal cuz why not lol.
Bonus: Can make Gunzerk last forever with different (minor) side effects listed in the mod.
This is really OP and I don't recommend this unless you hate fun or hate BL2. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


-DorkHeck = loser

Self explanatory, makes DorkHeck a confirmed loser lul Just some friendly banter.
Again another useless mod that does nothing in-game. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


-Constant Reaper

Makes Reaper give the same 8% per point gun damage (multiplicitave if I'm not mistaken) at all times instead of it only being active when the enemy has over 50% HP.


-BAR Modify

Changes how the BAR system works in various ways.
I can't be bothered to explain all the changes since I'm done with this mod unless people want me to do something more with it later.
Just check it out in BLCMM and see for yourself, it's pretty cool.
Thanks to c0dyc0de for being good at this stuff and indirectly helping me code this.
